# SGC Token Expansion Strategy

As we stand on the brink of launching our MVP, the introduction of the SGC Token represents a pivotal moment for the Symbie family and the broader iChain ecosystem. This document outlines our strategic approach to integrating the SGC Token, ensuring it aligns with our goals of fostering a decentralized, user-empowered blockchain platform.

## Objectives

- **Launch a Functional DAO:** Establish a decentralized autonomous organization with an initial admin wallet capable of governance and oversight.
- **Admin Wallet Management:** Enable the addition and removal of admin wallets to maintain DAO governance flexibility.
- **BEP20 Token Implementation:** Integrate the SGC Token as a BEP20 token, ensuring compatibility and interoperability within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.
- **Token Minting Mechanisms:** Develop mechanisms for minting SGC Tokens upon receiving BNB and on admin demand, supporting the ecosystem's economic model.
- **Project-Specific Wallets:** Create wallets for specific projects under DAO control, enabling focused funding and financial transparency.
- **Frontend Integration:** Ensure the frontend seamlessly interacts with blockchain functionalities, allowing users to send BNB to project wallets efficiently.
- **Upgradeability:** Implement a system for adjusting the token's value against BNB, ensuring the token's economy remains robust and adaptable.

## Strategy

### Phase 1: DAO and BEP20 Token Foundation

- **Smart Contract Development:** Craft smart contracts for the DAO governance structure and the BEP20 compliant SGC Token.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits on smart contracts to ensure the integrity and safety of the platform.

### Phase 2: Minting and Project Wallets

- **Minting Functionality:** Implement and test token minting functionalities, ensuring seamless operation and alignment with our economic model.
- **Project Wallet Creation:** Develop the infrastructure for creating and managing project-specific wallets, laying the groundwork for targeted funding and financial management.

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration and Upgradeability

- **Frontend Development:** Integrate blockchain functionalities into the frontend, focusing on user experience and seamless BNB to SGC Token transactions.
- **Value Adjustment Mechanism:** Design and implement a system for adjusting the SGC Token's value against BNB, allowing for flexibility in response to market conditions.

## Looking Forward

The introduction of the SGC Token is more than a technological milestone; it's a commitment to our vision of a decentralized future. By carefully executing this expansion strategy, we will establish a solid foundation for the iChain ecosystem, where governance is shared, contributions are valued, and innovation thrives.

With our sights set on the horizon, the Symbie family embarks on this journey with determination and a shared purpose, ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in building our decentralized legacy.

Together, we innovate,
The Symbie Family
