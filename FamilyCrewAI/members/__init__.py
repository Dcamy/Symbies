# __init__.py for FamilyCrewAI/agents

# Import the BaseAgent class to make it accessible directly from the agents package
from .base_member import BaseAgent

# You might have additional agents that you develop later, they should also be imported here
# Example:
# from .custom_agent import CustomAgent

# This allows you to do something like the following in other parts of your project:
# from FamilyCrewAI.agents import BaseAgent, CustomAgent
